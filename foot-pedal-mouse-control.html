    <h1>Sending Mouse Clicks with Feet</h1>

    <!-- <h2>Introduction & Purpose</h2> -->
    <p>This is a 3 pedel foot switch I constructed to perform mouse clicks with my feet.</p>
    <p>Link to Arduino code: <a href="https://github.com/georgekuegler/foot-mouse">GitHub Repository</a></p>
    <p>This project is part of an overall effort for hands-free computer accessibility.
        See the <a href="https://github.com/georgekuegler/TrackIRMouse">TrackIRMouse</a> project for controlling the
        cursor position with head tracking.</p>

    <p>If you're coming from the 'head tracking' project, now we need a way to press the mouse buttons with our feet.
        One option is voice commands, but that is simply too slow.
        Another option is a wonderful product called 'Smyle Mouse'. It's aimed at people with a range of disabilities
        and
        motor function. Smyle Mouse uses facial recognition to track your head moving to via your eyebrows and lips. It
        had
        excellent smoothing as it was aimed at people with a range of motor functions.</p>

    <p>I needed the speed & precision only a physical button press could provide.
        So, I turned to my feet.</p>

    <!-- ## The First Prototype

I started with the foot pedal that came with my electric piano.  -->

    <h2>Components & Design</h2>
    <!-- (annotated picture pointing to everything & #'ed) -->
    <!-- brief explanation why i chose each component -->

    <ul>
        <li>Teensy 4.0</li>
        <li>Proto-Board</li>
        <li>Plastic Enclosure</li>
        <li>(3) 1/4" TS Female Jacks</li>
        <li>(3) 10Kohmn Resistors</li>
        <li>(3) Yamaha FC5 Sustain Foot Switches</li>
        <li>Various wire, solder, & standoffs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Teensy 4.0</h2>
    <p>I chose the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html">Teensy 4.0</a> as my microcontroller.
        With a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M7 CPU running at 600MHz, this board is a bit overkill for the scope of the project.
        However, the community is very active and Paul Stoffregen had insured solid libraries are available.</p>

    <p>Reasons I chose the Teensy 4.0:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Native USB support for keyboard, mouse, & serial</li>
        <li>Arduino compatible & IDE support</li>
        <li>Triggerable bootloader from USB</li>
        <li>Compact form factor</li>
        <li>Plenty of processor speed and gpio pins for future expansion</li>
        <li>Great community support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Flashing over USB was important to me. The Teensy boards support flashing without needing to physically press the
        reset button. I can keep the board installed into an enclosure and update the firmware without removing any
        covers.
    </p>

    <p>The Arduino IDE makes it easy to compile and flash hardware out-of-the-box. Configuring compiler options is
        straightforward in the UI as well.</p>

    <h2>Yamaha FC5 Sustain Foot Switch</h2>
    <p>I knew I needed a tough foot switch, something I could use with shoes, as I'd be using this in a public office.
        I was skeptical about existing USB mouse buttons I found on the market.</p>
    <p>The Yamaha FC5 Sustain Foot Switch had the qualiies I was looking for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Robust</li>
        <li>Inexpensive</li>
        <li>Removeable Grips</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>First Prototype</h1>
    <p>Here's my humble 1st prototype. I connected 2 wires from the left-click terminals of an old mouse circuitboard to
        a female guitar jack.</p>

# Challenges & Highlights
- what problems was i trying to solve?
  - match speed and precision of an index finger mouseclick
  - make sure feet don't get tired
- how did i solve the problems I intended to solve?
  - rigid body and rigid mounting improve mouse feel and increase speed
  - inverted click operation keeps feet from getting tired
- what unexpectedly clever solutions came about? (the reverse pedal click)
  - see above
- include a picture of the original?
